# Evaluation Question #1- How has the average age of a Bachelor Contestant changed over time (from 2002-as close to present as data allows)? 
## *This data covers Seasons 1-23 (2002-2019)
## Use ANCOVA

# Evaluation Question #2- Is a Bachelor contestantâ€™s hometown region a predictor for success on the show?
## Use Independent Chi Square

## Subset of data- Only seasons

bcageseasononly <- c("age", "season")
bachelorcontestants2 <- bachelorcontestants[bcageseasononly]

str(bachelorcontestants$season)

## Output shows that it is an INTEGER- Need to convert to a factor

bachelorcontestants$season <- as.factor(bachelorcontestants$season)

str(bachelorcontestants$season)

## Success!  Now IV is a factor

## Make sure CV's are factors

### Both not a factor

# ANCOVA Testing Assumptions

## Normality

plotNormalHistogram(bachelorcontestants$age)

### Not too bad- but could probably be a little more normal- Try square formation

bachelorcontestants$ageSQ <- bachelorcontestants$age * bachelorcontestants$age
plotNormalHistogram(bachelorcontestants$ageSQ)

### Still not great- Try log

bachelorcontestants$ageLOG <- log(bachelorcontestants$age)
plotNormalHistogram(bachelorcontestants$ageLOG)

### Best option!  Go with log- Now test meets the assumptions of normality

## Homogeneity of Variance

leveneTest(ageLOG~season, data=bachelorcontestants)

### This test is not significant- Assumption met

## Homogeneity of Regression Slopes ***

Homogeneity_RegrSlp = lm(ageLOG~hometown.region, data=bachelorcontestants)
anova(Homogeneity_RegrSlp)

### P-value is significant, so assumption not met- Do NOT use 'hometown region' as covariate; Instead use as second IV? ***

Homogeneity_RegrSlp1 = lm(ageLOG~occupation, data=bachelorcontestants)
anova(Homogeneity_RegrSlp1)

### P-value is not significant, so assumption is met- 'occupation' good to go as CV

# Independent Chi Square Data Wrangling- Should I subset for just 'Winners/Runner Ups" or leave as is? (see "as is" at 245)

## Subset data for only 'eliminated' and 'hometown.region'

# Change all "Runner-up" to "Runner-Up"

# Independent Chi Square Testing Assumptions

## First assumption is to have independent data- Each person/object must be able to fit in only one cell; Met? ***

## Second assumption is that your expected frequencies must be greater than 5 for each cell

CrossTable(bachelorcontestants4$hometown.region, bachelorcontestants4$eliminated, fisher=TRUE, chisq = TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid=TRUE, format= "SPSS")

## Many Expected Values less than 5- Does not meet assumption > account for it in explanation (say "it requires additional research)

## Results: p-Value > 0.05 (Analysis not significant; Hometown region does not impact contestant success on the show); No need to do Post-Hocs since results not significant

# ANCOVA Data Wrangling- Try 2 (Remove 'hometown' column to see if all assumptions met)

## Subset of data- without 'hometown'

## Make sure CV's are factors

str(bachelorcontestants5$hometown.region)
str(bachelorcontestants5$occupation)

### Both factors- success!

# ANCOVA Testing Assumptions- Try 2 (without 'hometown' column)

## Normality

### Not too bad- but could probably be a little more normal- Try square formation

### Best option!  Go with log- Now test meets the assumption of normality

## Homogeneity of Variance

leveneTest(ageLOG~season, data=bachelorcontestants5)

### This test is not significant- Assumption met

## Homogeneity of Regression Slopes ***

Homogeneity_RegrSlp2 = lm(ageLOG~hometown.region, data=bachelorcontestants5)
